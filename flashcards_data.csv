Internet layer,Encapsulates packets into Internet datagrams and deals with routing between different networks.
Internet Protocol (IP),The main protocol in the TCP/IP suite is responsible for logical addressing and routing of packets between hosts and networks.
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP),Used for hardware address resolution. Each host has a link or network interface layer address usually called the Media Access Control (MAC) address to identify it on the local physical network.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),Sends messages and reports on errors regarding packet delivery.
Transport layer,These protocols provide communication sessions between computers.
Transport Control Protocol (TCP),Provides connection-oriented delivery. This means that the delivery is reliable and that packets are delivered in the correct sequence.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP),Provides connectionless delivery - there is no guarantee that packets will arrive in the correct sequence.
Application layer,The top level of the architecture contains protocols that provide the communications formats for exchanging data between hosts.
IP Addresses,Used to logically identify each device (host) on a given network. A 32-bit binary value.
Network prefix length or subnet mask,Each host must also be configured into a subnet mask in order to distinguish the network ID and host ID portions within an address.
MAC Addresses,At the data link layer each host is identified by the address of its network interface. MAC Address is a 48-bit value expressed in hex notation.
Routing,If the destination IP address is a local one (with the same network ID as the source) the host uses ARP messaging to discover the local destination host.
